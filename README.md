## Problems I Faced  
#### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Template Generation  
The first challenge I encountered was **generating the news templates**. Initially, I considered using template generation APIs like **Bannerbear**, but they turned out to be inconvenient and didn‚Äôt meet my specific requirements.  

**Solution:**  
- I decided to create the templates myself using **HTML & CSS** for complete customization.  
- To streamline the process, I utilized **Django** for dynamic template generation and **JavaScript** combined with **html2canvas** for auto-downloading the templates.

#### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Instagram Bot Detection  
Another issue was that Instagram could detect and block bots. This posed a significant challenge to automated posting.  

**Solution:**  
- To overcome this, I implemented a **time-sleep feature** to introduce delays between posts. This helped mimic human behavior and avoid detection by Instagram's bot interface.

These solutions not only resolved the problems but also made the system more robust and flexible.
